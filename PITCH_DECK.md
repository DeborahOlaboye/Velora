## Mutual Aid for the Modern Worker

**Empowering Gig Workers with Financial Security Through Community**

---

## SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM

### 1.7 Billion Gig Workers Have NO Safety Net

**The harsh reality:**
- **78%** of gig workers live paycheck to paycheck
- **63%** can't cover a $500 emergency expense
- **Zero** access to employer benefits (PTO, sick leave, emergency funds)
- **Traditional banking excludes them**: No credit history = No emergency loans
- **Predatory alternatives**: Payday loans charge 400%+ APR

### The Gig Economy is Growing, But Workers Are Falling Behind

- Global gig economy: **$455 billion** (2023)
- Projected to reach **$1.5 trillion** by 2030
- Workers deserve the same safety nets as traditional employees

**Bottom Line:** Millions of hard-working people are one emergency away from financial ruin.

---

## SLIDE 2: THE SOLUTION

### Velora: A Self-Governed Emergency Fund Platform

**We're building the financial safety net gig workers deserve.**

#### How It Works (Simple):
1. **Pool Together**: Workers contribute $5-50/month to a shared emergency fund
2. **Verify Identity**: Optional KYC unlocks 2x higher withdrawal limits
3. **Request When Needed**: Emergency situations trigger withdrawal requests
4. **Community Decides**: Democratic voting approves legitimate emergencies (60% threshold)
5. **Get Funded Instantly**: Approved withdrawals transfer in seconds

#### Why It's Revolutionary:
- **0% Platform Fees** - Every dollar goes to workers, not executives
- **Democratic Governance** - Community votes, not algorithms
- **Blockchain Transparent** - All transactions visible on-chain
- **Mobile-First** - Built for the smartphone generation
- **Globally Accessible** - No bank account required

## SLIDE 13: RISKS & MITIGATION

### Key Risks

#### 1. Regulatory Risk

- Legal counsel in each market
- DAO structure (decentralized control)
- Stablecoin usage (not fiat)
- Community-governed (not company-operated)

#### 2. Smart Contract Risk
**Risk**: Bug or exploit drains pool funds

**Risk**: Users fake emergencies to withdraw

**Mitigation**:
- Community voting (60% approval)
- 7-day voting period (time to investigate)
- 90-day cooldown between withdrawals
- Reputation system (track approval rates)
- Self Protocol verification (Tier 2)

#### 4. Market Risk
**Risk**: Crypto bear market reduces adoption

**Mitigation**:
- Stablecoin usage (cUSD = $1)
- Not speculative (utility-focused)
- GoodDollar UBI offsets crypto volatility
- Fiat on-ramp partnerships (future)

#### 5. Competition Risk
**Risk**: Larger player copies model

**Mitigation**:
